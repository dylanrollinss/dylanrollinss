Howdy! I'm Dylan. I have a B.S in Statistics from Texas A&M University—Gig Em! I utilize Python, R, and C++ to provide efficient solutions to a range of problems.

Some of my interests include: machine learning, classification algorithms, high-dimensional data analysis, and bayesian classification. 

In my free time, I enjoy taking digital and film photos—my work has been featured by the City of Chicago.

I used em—dashes before they were cewl!
