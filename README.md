Howdy! I just graduated from Texas A&M University. I utilize Python, R, and C++ to solve relevant, real-world problems.

Some of my interests include: machine learning, classification algorithms, high-dimensional data analysis, and bayesian classification. 

In my free time, I enjoy taking digital and film photos. My work has been featured by the City of Chicago.
